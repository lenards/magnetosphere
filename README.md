# (Assuming) Mac
- ensure XCode is install

- agree to the XCode license: `sudo xcodebuild -license`

- install [brew](http://brew.sh/) (if not already installed)

- install Virtualbox via "brew cask"

```
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask
brew cask install virtualbox
```

- install vagrant

```
brew cask install vagrant
```

## using `vagrant`

Note: _depending on your connection's bandwidth this could take 2 to 5 minutes..._

```
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64

==> box: Loading metadata for box 'ubuntu/trusty64'
    box: URL: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/trusty64

```

- You can also download the vagrant `ubuntu/trusty64` [box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64) through the HashiCorp website.


## Get Magnetosphere

```
git clone https://github.com/lenards/magnetosphere.git
```

## Inside `MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME`

We will _stage_ the missing *"bits"* that are necessary for installation in the folder where our `Vagrantfile` is. I will refer to this as `MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME` when walking through the steps for getting the vagrant VM working. 

For the most part, the missing *"bits"* are all available for the Atmosphere team in the _secrets_ repo. But Clank discusses [these files](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank#list-of-files-needed-before-hand) as well.

Our goal is for `MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME` to looking like this:
```
$ tree -L 1 . 
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── Vagrantfile
├── pre-flight-check.sh
├── kickstart.sh
└── scratch
    ├── {{secrets-repo}}
    └── clank
```

We need to: 
- [ ] ensure _{{secrets-repo}}_ in place within `MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME`
- [ ] Clank is cloned into `MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME`

**NOTE:** you may want to change `MOCK_USERNAME` in `variables.yml@vagrant`


## Get Clank

- clone [clank](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank)
```
# from MAGNETOSPHERE_HOME, if `scratch` is not present ... `mkdir scratch`
$ pwd
... the path to the clone of this repo ... 
$ cd scratch
$ git clone https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank.git
```

## Secrets

... you'll have to ask @lenards or @steve-gregory about that (for _now_)

```

You can see a live capture of the `vagrant up` process if you are [_curious_](https://asciinema.org/a/cwwjic9lttp5aewfzuui7c3xg).

Once that's done, you've got a running virtual machine to log into. 


## Snapshot - it's _quite_ progressive 

Since we are using VirtualBox (VBox) as a provider, we'll use a VBox-specific _vagrant plugin_ to handling saving snapshots. 

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbox-snapshot 
Installing the 'vagrant-vbox-snapshot' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-vbox-snapshot (0.0.10)'!
```

The commands are slightly different than what you'll see in the Vagrant docs for `vagrant snapshot`:

```
$ vagrant snapshot help
Usage: vagrant snapshot <command> [<args>]

Available subcommands:
     back
     delete
     go
     list
     take

For help on any individual command run `vagrant snapshot <command> -h`

```

Before we log into the box, we should create an initial _snapshot_ that we can _restore_ to later (if needed). The command within the plugin we want is `take`, we need to provide a name for the snapshot and _vm-name_ (this is defined within the `Vagrantfile`):

```
$ vagrant snapshot take --help 
Take snapshot

Usage: vagrant snapshot take [vm-name] <SNAPSHOT_NAME>
```

By default, the `Vagrantfile` file specifies `atmosphere-dev` as the _vm-name_.

```
$ vagrant snapshot take atmosphere-dev INIT
Taking snapshot INIT
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Snapshot taken. UUID: 2d60fb56-49ab-4a11-ad15-876c0129cdb1
```

For more information, see the README for [vagrant-vbox-snapshot](https://github.com/dergachev/vagrant-vbox-snapshot) repository.


## Step inside ... 

Let's log into the vagrant box we've created:
```
vagrant ssh
```

Everything on your local machine (which is the "host") is accessible within the vagrant (guest) box via `/vagrant`.  We can use this to our advantage when providing data or trying to get files out of the _guest_ to the _host_.


## Run `kickstart.sh` 

_(ensure that the `pre-flight-check.sh` passes prior to this step)_

This is going to run the combination of `ratchet.py` &  playbooks in [clank](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank). 

We're going to use a slight abstraction to run _ratchet & clank_ that mimics how all build & deploys happen (we do this via Jenkins as a shell-script build step, but we're calling that _step_ `kickstart.sh`).

_{{not complete}}_ 
```
$ vagrant ssh 
... 
$ sudo su - 
$ cd /vagrant
$ ./pre-flight-check.sh
...
$ ./kickstart.sh
...
... «such output; much fact; lvl=ansible»
$ service atmosphere status
...
$ service nginx restart
$ service atmosphere start
```

## Getting the Databases Loaded... 

_*NOTE*: this step is something that should be (very soon) done by Clank_ 

You will need to know what the database names are in use. Lucky for us, the information was present in the _BUILD_ENV_ file. 

So we can grep for `DBNAME` and find the names of the databases that Clank created during the _kickstart_:

```
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant# grep DBNAME $BUILD_ENV_PATH/variables.yml@vagrant 
ATMO_DBNAME: aeolian
TROPO_DBNAME: thermogram
```

We need to do the next actions as `postgres` user: 
```
$ su - postgres
$ cd /vagrant
...
... `ls` or check on your sql-dump paths since we're being all manual
...
$ psql -d aeolian < /vagrant/prod-sql-dump-for-atmosphere-release-date.sql
... such output ...
$ psql -d thermogram < /vagrant/prod-sql-dump-for-troposphere-release-date.sql
... such output ... 
$ exit 
$ service postgresql restart 
$ service atmosphere restart 
```

You can verify that the API is working as expected by going to the Django REST Framework page for the API (in your _host_, aka your Mac): 
```
open https://192.168.72.19/api/sizes
```

## After ... 

- review "docs" (that doesn't exist) about secrets ... 


## Notes 

### VirtualBox-specific `vagrant snapshot` 

If you hit a failure in `./kickstart.sh`, or you are developing extensions to the existing Magnetosphere, you might find these examples useful.

#### List available snapshots

```
 $ vagrant snapshot list 
Listing snapshots for 'atmosphere-dev':
   Name: INIT (UUID: 2d60fb56-49ab-4a11-ad15-876c0129cdb1)
```

#### Going back to a previous state

_(You will need to include the _vm-name_ to do this)_

```
$ vagrant snapshot back -h 
Back to current snapshot

Usage: vagrant snapshot back [vm-name]
```

If we wanted to move `atmosphere-dev` _back_ to the previous state:
```
 $ vagrant snapshot back atmosphere-dev
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Restoring snapshot 28c20f48-58cf-448e-9ab2-6a4083faaee5
Starting restored VM
==> atmosphere-dev: Checking if box 'ubuntu/trusty64' is up to date...
==> atmosphere-dev: A newer version of the box 'ubuntu/trusty64' is available! You currently
==> atmosphere-dev: have version '20160127.0.0'. The latest is version '20160222.0.0'. Run
==> atmosphere-dev: `vagrant box update` to update.
==> atmosphere-dev: Resuming suspended VM...
==> atmosphere-dev: Booting VM...
==> atmosphere-dev: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    atmosphere-dev: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2200
    atmosphere-dev: SSH username: vagrant
    atmosphere-dev: SSH auth method: private key
==> atmosphere-dev: Machine booted and ready!
```

#### Restoring a specific snapshot

We can just go to the _previous_ snapshot with `vagrant snapshot back [vm-name]`. 

But we might want to go back to a state prior to _just_ the previous one and we can do that with the following: 
```
vagrant snapshot go [vm-name] <SNAPSHOT_NAME>
```

### VirtualBox Provider Info ... 
You might want install Mac specifics for hosting VirtualBox

**Note:** _if you have a Virtualbox VMs running, they **must** be suspended/halted..._

It appears that the current `virtualbox` cask is including the extension pack. But if for some reason you need to install it, there is a _brew cask_:
```
brew cask install virtualbox-extension-pack
```
